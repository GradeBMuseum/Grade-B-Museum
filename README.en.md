# Grade-B Museum

A personal experimental project where deliberately useless features  
are implemented with serious intent.

Grade-B Museum is a personal project that presents intentionally impractical features  
in the form of "exhibits".

The purpose of this project is not to solve problems,  
but to demonstrate how precisely unnecessary features  
can be designed and implemented.

The features are useless,  
but the implementation is taken seriously.

## Philosophy

- This project does **not** aim to solve problems
- Features that would never be built in real-world products are intentionally designed
- Each exhibit focuses on a single idea
- The quality of implementation is never compromised

> Useless by design.  
> Serious by implementation.
